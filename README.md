# LWJGL Graphics Project Template

This program is a template for getting an LWJGL 2.9.2 project up and running with minimal effort. This repository is meant for my own reference, but anyone is welcome to learn from it.

## Getting Started

This project is designed to run on Windows, but it can easily be run on other platforms by running code similar to that in the build script.

To run this project on Windows, just extract to a folder, and run build.bat. You can move around the game world using the WASD keys, look around with the mouse, move up and down using Space/Shift, and exit using the Escape key.

## Prerequisites

This project requires that you have Java installed and that you can compile and run Java programs using the console. There are many resources online that show you how to add Java to your PATH environment variable.
